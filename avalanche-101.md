# Avalanche 101

## Basics

- slope is less than 20° => no avalanche

### Equipment

Do not ever go skiing offsite without proper equipment! The chances go rapidly down when you don't have any.

#### Time to rescue ⏳

- with full basic equipment - up to 15 minutes
- without probe - up to 26 minutes
- without any equipment - up to 60 minutes ⚠️ !!!People usually die after `15 minutes` under the snow!!!

#### Basic equipment (approx. 200€)

- Probe
- Shovel - metal, not plastic
- Bacon - do not buy used ones, they are usually crap


## Myths

### There is no avalanche in forest

Sure there is. It's even `more dangerous` than regular avalanche because of the trees! Only when the forrest is so dense, it may be avalanche free, but that's very unlikely. 

### Professionals will take care of me

`95%` of people will die after `15 minutes` in an avalanche. Average rescue team arrival time is about `15 mintes`. Your best chance for rescue are the people with you!

### Areas close to ski slopes are safe

There is not much difference between area next to the slope and some other in the wild. Both are covered with a fresh snow. Layers in areas close to the slopes may be disrupted because skiers cross them more often, but there is no guarantee.

### Snow fence doesn't help with avalanche

They are primarily employed to minimize the amount of snowdrift on roadways and railways.
