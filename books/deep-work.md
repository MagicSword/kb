# Deep Work

## Introduction

### What is Deep Work
> Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that pushes your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

- It's a skill that has a value today
- Most modern knowledge workers - a group that rapidly forgets a value of going deep

### Shallow Work
> Noncignitively demanding, logistical tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

### Two Core abilities for thriving in a new economy

1. The ability to quickly master hard things - "If you can't learn, you can't thrive"
2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed - If you don't produce, you won't thrive, no matter how talented you are!

### Attention residue

When switching from Task A to Task B, your mind doesn't immediately follow and still thinks about Task A. It's better to work on one task for a longer time than constantly switching.


## Deep work is Rare

### Big businesses prevent people going deep

- Facebook introducing open offices,...
- People expect you to read and respond to email in a timely manner
- Regular meetings - they are easy to schedule but don't add much value
  
### Business as a proxy for Productivity

In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity - doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.


## Deep work is Meaningful

We live in an era where anything Internet-related is understood by default to be innovative and necessary. Depth destroying behaviors such as immediate email responses and an active social media presence is lauded, while avoidance of these trends generate suspicion.

> Who you are, what you think, feel and do, what you love - is the sum of what you focus on

> Idle mind is a devils workshop - when you lose focus, your mind tends to fix on what could be wrong with your life instead of what's right

Jobs are easier to Enjoy than free time. They generate value and have built-in goals.


## Rule #1: Work deeply

You have a limited willpower to concentrate and stay in a state of deep work, but habits will help

**Rhytmic philosophy** - Generate a rhythm and avoid wasting time on deciding when to go deep

There is no "one correct" deep work ritual, but every ritual should address these questions (Finding a correct one might require experimentation).

- Where you will work and for how long
- How you'll work once you start work (What you use, what is banned,...)
- How you'll support your work ("Walk before, a cup of coffee,...)

### Execute like a business

1. Focus on a wildly important - The more you try, the less you actually accomplish
2. Measure your success - e.g.: Time spent in a state of a deep work dedicated toward your wildly important goal
3. Keep a compelling scoreboard - "People play differently when they're keeping score"
4. Create a cadence of Accountability


## Rule #2: Embrace boredom

> The ability to concentrate deeply is a skill that must be trained

Constant online attention switching has a negative impact on your brain. People who multitask all the time can't filter out irrelevant. They can't manage a working memory. They're chronically distracted. They initiate much larger parts of their brain that are irrelevant to the task at hand... they are pretty much mental wrecks. 

### Don't take breaks from distraction. Instead, take breaks from Focus.

Constant switching from low-stimuli/high-value activities, at the slightest hint of boredom or cognitive challenge, that teaches your mind to never tolerate an absence of novelty.

To succeed, you must rewire your brain to be comfortable resisting distracting stimuli. It's sufficient that you eliminate the ability of such behavior to hijack your attention.

#### Be wary of Distractions and Looping

When your attention slips away, remind yourself that you can return to that thought later and redirect your attention back


## Rule #3: Quit Social Media

- Any-benefit approach - when you find any good reason for using the tool/service
- Craftsman approach - When you also consider the cons of using tool/service (time invested, consumed, ...)

### Don't use the internet to entertain yourself

Use 16 hours outside your work to work on yourself and improve your life. Put more thought into your leisure time.
It's crucial to put a thought into what you're going to do with your evenings and weekends before they begin.


## Rule #4: Drain the shallows

### Schedule every minute of your day
> We spend much time of a day on autopilot. It's difficult to avoid shallow when you don't think about what you're going to do.

- The Goal is not to stick with a schedule at all costs
- It is okay to ignore rest of the schedule if something important or insightful comes into it

### Quantify depth of every activity

How long would it take to train a smart colleague graduate with no specialized training in my field to complete this task? If the answer is many months, that indicated that task leverages hard-won expertise.
