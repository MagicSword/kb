# Deep Work

## Introduction

### What is Deep Work
> Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

- It's a skill that has a value today
- Most modern knowledge workers - a group that rapidly forgets a value of going deep

### Shallow Work
> Noncignitively demanding, logistical tasks, often performed while distracted. Theese efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

### Two Core abilities for thriving in a new economy

1. The ability to quickly master hard things - "If you can't learn, you can't thrive"
2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed - If you don't produce, you won't thrive, no matter how talented you are!

### Attention residue

When switching from Task A to Task B, your mind doesn't imediatelly follow and still thinks about Task A. It's better to work on one task for a longer time than constantly switching.


## Deep work is Rare

### Big businesses prevent people going deep

- Facebook introducing open offices,...
- People expect you to read and respond to email in a timely manner
- Regular meetings - they are easy to schedule, but don't add much value
  
### Business as a proxy for Productivity

In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity - doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.
