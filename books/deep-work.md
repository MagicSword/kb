# Deep Work

## Introduction

### What is Deep Work
> Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

- It's a skill that has a value today
- Most modern knowledge workers - a group that rapidly forgets a value of going deep

### Shallow Work
> Noncignitively demanding, logistical tasks, often performed while distracted. Theese efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

### Two Core abilities for thriving in a new economy

1. The ability to quickly master hard things - "If you can't learn, you can't thrive"
2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed - If you don't produce, you won't thrive, no matter how talented you are!

### Attention residue

When switching from Task A to Task B, your mind doesn't imediatelly follow and still thinks about Task A. It's better to work on one task for a longer time than constantly switching.


## Deep work is Rare

### Big businesses prevent people going deep

- Facebook introducing open offices,...
- People expect you to read and respond to email in a timely manner
- Regular meetings - they are easy to schedule, but don't add much value
  
### Business as a proxy for Productivity

In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity - doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.


## Deep work is Meaningful

We live in an era where anything Internet related is understood by default to be innovative and necessary. Depth destroying behaviours such as immediate email responses and an active social media presence are lauded, while avoidance of these trends generate suspicion.

> Who you are, what you think, feel and do, what you love - is the sum of what you focus on

> Idle mind is a devils workshop - when you lose focus, your mind tends to fix on what could be wrong with your life instead of what's right

Jobs are easier to Enjoy than free time. They generate value and have built-in goals.


## Rule #1: Work deeply

You have a limited willpower to concentrate and stay in a state of deep work, but habits will help

**Rhytmic phylosofy** - Generate a rhythm and avoid wasting time on deciding when to go deep

There is no "one correct" deep work ritual, but every ritual should address these questions (Finding a correct one might require experimentation).

- Where you will work and for how long
- How you'll work once you start work (What you use, what is banned,...)
- How you'll support your work ("Walk before, cup of coffee,...)

### Execute like a business

1. Focus on a wildly important - The more you try, the less you actually acomplish
2. Measure your success - e.g.: Time spent in a state of a deep work dedicated toward your wildly important goal
3. Keep a compelling scoreboard - "People play differently when they're keeping score"
4. Create a cadence of Accountability
