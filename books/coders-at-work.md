# Coders at Work - Reflections on the craft of programming

## Introduction

> Yet despite the millions of people who have written code, and the billions, if not trillions of lines of code written since the field began, it still often feels like we're still making it up as we go along. People still argue about what programming is: mathematics or engineering? Craft, art, or science?

## Jamie Zawinski

> And C++ is just an abomination. Everything is wrong with it in every way.

> Which is a distinction I don't really buy - "programming" versus "scripting". I think that's nonsense.

> Well, it was a decision like not using C++ and not using threads that made us ship the product on time.

> Ship the fucking thing! It's great to rewrite your code and make it cleaner and by the third time, it'll actually be pretty. But that's not the point - you're not here to write code; you're here to ship products.


## Brad Fitzpatrick

> You've probably seen the Windows API - there are like twenty parameters to every function...

> I think it's really important to know the whole stack even if you don't operate within the whole stack.

> I remember our database class was taught by someone who, it seemed, had no real-world experience with databases.

> Read code. I heard this a lot, but it didn't really sink in until later. There were a number of years when I wrote a lot of code and never read anyone else's.

> Of if you really respect some programmer, go read some of their code. Maybe that'll make you realize that they're mortal and they're not really someone you should be idolizing. Or you learn something about their code.

> I often look for people that have done, like, a lot of stuff on their own that wasn't asked of them. Not just their school project or just what their previous employer had them do. Somebody who was passionate about something and had some side project.

> My basic rule is, if it could possibly come from the end user, it's not a run-time crash. But if it is my code to my code, I crash it as hard as possible - fail as early as possible.

> There are so many layers of abstraction that people don't know what the hell is going on underneath because the computers are so damn fast that it hides your stupidity.

> Users always like to get the one with the higher version number even if it sucks more.

## Douglas Crockford

> Most of the JavaScript defects are not in the current implementations - they are in the specification.

> We need to figure out what do they do right and what is it missing and refocus them, rather than just piling new features on top.

> Spend time on a regular basis reading each other's code.

> As part of my personal discipline, I don't use continue ever.

> Readability of code is now my first priority. It's more important than being fast, almost as important as being correct.

> I also see a lot of folks struggling to try to make stuff fast in situations where it absolutely doesn't need to go fast.

> Part of what makes programming difficult is most of the time we're doing stuff we've never done before.

> The world has been pretty much taken over by computers now and in order to defend yourself, or to be a full citizen, you have to have some understanding of how these things work.

> I think we're tragically unaware of our history, and I'm often really disappointed to see that people who are now practicing this craft having no intellectual curiosity about where this stuff came from.

# Brendan Eich 

> You see crazy, idiotic statements about how dynamic language are going to totally unseat Java and static languages, which is nonsense.

> Once you combine code with other people's code it just gets out of control

> I have this big allergy to ivory-tower design and design patterns. Peter Norvig, when he was at Harlequin, he did this paper about how design patterns are really just flaws in you're programming language. Get a better programming language. He's absolutely right.

## Joshua Bloch

> It's easier to optimize correct code than to correct optimized code.

> When you choose a language, you're choosing more than a set of technical trade-offs - you're choosing a community. It's like choosing a bar.

> So for a lot of people, anymore, programming is about gluing stuff together.

## Joe Armstrong

> Being a young programmer today must be awful - you're paralyzed by choice.

> You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle.

> If you want to understand C, write a C compiler.

> I believe this Unix philosophy - a program should do what it's supposed to do and nothing else.

> I like documentation. I don't think a program is finished until you've written some reasonable documentation.

> The code shows me what it does. It doesn't show me what it's supposed to do.

> What should one do to become a better programmer? Spend 20 percent of your time learning stuff - because it's compounded.

## Simon Peyton Jones

> Almost everything turns out to be interesting because the subject grows ahead of you.

> What's the equivalent of UML diagrams for a functional language? It's the type system.

## Peter Norvig

> When I was in school, working as a team was called cheating.

> Ten percent of the time it is a really good idea to sit down together because you want that shared understanding.

## Guy Steele

> I think programming is probably a more difficult activity than it was 30 years ago.

> The only way to manage complexity is to keep things, including our programming languages, very simple.

## Dan Ingalls

> It isn't that young people learn that much faster; it's just they have more time. When I would put time in, I made progress.

## Ken Thompson

> Modern programming scares me in many respects, where they will just build layer after layer after layer that does nothing except translate.

## Fran Allen

> I picked up probably a habit from that of learning about programming and learning about a new language by taking an existing program and studying it.

## Bernie Cosell

> But sometimes I would get a piece of code - often one that other people couldn't make work - and I would say, "This is way too complicated.". So I would think through what it was supposed to do, throw it away, and write it again from scratch.

> Classes can give you a lot of stuff, but in the end programming is a craft you have to perfect by plying it.

## Donald Knuth

> I think programming is a lot like religion; people have their beliefs.

> There's this overemphasis on reusable software where you never get to open up the box and see what's inside the box.
