> A young man is on the subway, carrying a guitar case. He’s a member of a band that is performing a concert at Carnegie Hall; and he’s running late. He dashes off the train and up the stairs, and realizes he’s lost. He knows that the performance hall is close, but he doesn’t know the direction. So he stops an old man on the street and asks: “Excuse me sir, but how do I get to Carnegie Hall?” The old man looks at the lad with his guitar case and says: “Practice son, Practice.”
