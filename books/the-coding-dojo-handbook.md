## Intro

http://codingdojo.org

> A young man is on the subway, carrying a guitar case. He‚Äôs a member of a band that is performing a concert at Carnegie Hall; and he‚Äôs running late. He dashes off the train and up the stairs, and realizes he‚Äôs lost. He knows that the performance hall is close, but he doesn‚Äôt know the direction. So he stops an old man on the street and asks: ‚ÄúExcuse me sir, but how do I get to Carnegie Hall?‚Äù The old man looks at the lad with his guitar case and says: ‚ÄúPractice son, Practice.‚Äù

- All professionals practice, but not all practice is equal. Professional practice games as well as drills.
- It's a great way to promote good practices amongst your colleagues
- The focus is not on delivering solutions, but rather on being aware what you actually do when you produce code and how to improve that process

> I‚Äôm not a great programmer, I‚Äôm just a good programmer with great habits - Kent Beck



## What is Coding Dojo?

It's a meeting where a bunch of coders get together, code, learn and have fun

Puzzling Code Kata + safe environment to discuss topics like design, testing, refactoring, tools... and you'll hardly be able to stop them talking

### Essential Dojo Elements

- Intro
- Moderation
- Retrospective
- Write tests
- Show your working

The `intro` and `moderation` are designed to make sure everyone feels safe to experiment and learn. The `retrospective` makes sure you reflect on what you've learned. Writing `tests` sets you up with a feedback mechanism on whether your code is working as you expect. Demonstrating `how you write the code` means you learn a mechanism to produce good code, not just what good code looks like.


## Collaborative Games for Programmers

A Collaborative Game is one where there is no individual winner, but rather all the participants must contribute to a solution.

### Randori

- Everyone can see the code, projected onto the wall, and everyone gets to write some code.
- No preparation needed
- Code to design decisions through discussion
- Suitable for groups of 4-10 people

#### Rules

1. If you have the keyboard, **you get to decide what to type**
2. If you have the keyboard and you don't know what to type, **ask for help**
3. If you are asked for help, **kindly respond to the best of your ability**
4. If you are not asked, but you see an opportunity for improvement or learning, **choose an appropriate moment to mention it.**

### Pair Switching Strategies

#### 1. Timebox

- each pair has 5-7 minutes
- after that, driver goes back to the audience, copilot becomes a driver and one from the audience step up as copilot
- ‚ûïeveryone has a go at driving
- ‚ûñyou get cut off in the middle of what you're doing

#### 2. Ping pong

- A writes test and hands the keyboard
- B writes the implementation, writes test and hands the keyboard

#### 3. NTests

- The pair write and implement N tests (1-3 tests)
- only works with experienced TTDers


### Randori Variants

#### 1. Driver/Navigator

Driver writes code. Navigator tells what to write (like in rally-car racing üèé)

#### 2. Randori in Paris

Ideal for larger groups (10+). Pairs (or trios) work on a Kata for 45-90 minutes. Apart from learning from each other during the coding, some of them should also present how they build up the solution to the whole group. 

#### 3. Musical Chairs Programming

Same as Randori in Paris but every 10 minutes each pair switch one member.
