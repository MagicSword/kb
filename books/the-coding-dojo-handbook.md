> A young man is on the subway, carrying a guitar case. He’s a member of a band that is performing a concert at Carnegie Hall; and he’s running late. He dashes off the train and up the stairs, and realizes he’s lost. He knows that the performance hall is close, but he doesn’t know the direction. So he stops an old man on the street and asks: “Excuse me sir, but how do I get to Carnegie Hall?” The old man looks at the lad with his guitar case and says: “Practice son, Practice.”

- All professionals practice, but not all practice is equal. Professional practice games as well as drills.
- It's a great way to promote good practices amongst your colleagues
- The focus is not on delivering solutions, but rather on being aware what you actually do when you produce code and how to improve that process

> I’m not a great programmer, I’m just a good programmer with great habits - Kent Beck



## What is Coding Dojo?

It's a meeting where a bunch of coders get together, code, learn and have fun

Puzzling Code Kata + safe environment to discuss topics like design, testing, refactoring, tools... and you'll hardly be able to stop them talking

### Essential Dojo Elements

- Intro
- Moderation
- Retrospective
- Write tests
- Show your working

The `intro` and `moderation` are designed to make sure everyone feels safe to experiment and learn. The `retrospective` makes sure you reflect on what you've learnt. Writing `tests` sets you up with a feedback mechanism on whether your code is working as you expect. Demonstrating `how you write the code` means you learn a mechanism to produce good code, not just what good code looks like.
