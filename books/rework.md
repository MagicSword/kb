# Rework

### The new reality

Starting a business on the side while keeping your day job can provide all the cash flow you need.

## Chapter Takedowns

### Learning from mistakes is overrated

Other people's failure is just other people's failure.

Another common misconception: You need to learn from your mistakes. What do you really learn from mistakes? You might learn what _not_ to do again, but how valuable is that? You still don't know what you should do next.

Success gives you real ammunition. Failure is just failure, you still don't know what you should do next.

Failure is not prerequisite for success.

### Planning is guessing

Sometimes you need to say, "We're going in a new direction because that's what makes sense today."

Decide what you're going to do this week, not this year. Figure out the next most important thing and do that.

### Why grow?

Why is expansion always the goal?

We don't look at Harvard and say - "If they'd only hire thousands more professors and go global... then it'd be a great school."

Grow slow and see what feels right. Premature hiring is the death of many companies.

Small businesses wish they were bigger. Big businesses dream about being more agile and flexible.

### Workaholism

Working more doesn't mean you care more or get more done. It just means you work more.

If all you do is work, you're unlikely to have sound judgments. Your values and decision making wind up skewed. You stop being able to decide what's worth extra effort and what's not.

### Enough with "entrepreneurs"

Everyone should be encouraged to start his own business, not just some rare breed that self-identifies as entrepreneurs.

You just need an idea, a touch of confidence, and a push to get started.

## Chapter Go

### Make a dent in the universe

Your efforts needs to feel valuable. You want to feel that if you stopped doing what you do, people would notice.

What you do is your legacy. Don't sit around and wait for someone else to make the change you want to see.

### Scratch your own itch

If you're solving someone else's problem, you're constantly stabbing in the dark. When you solve your own problem, the light comes on. You know exactly what the right answer is.

Best of all, this "solve your own problem" approach lets you fall in love with what you're making.

### Start making something

What you do is what matters, not what you think or say or plan.

### No time is no excuse

Instead of going to bed at ten, go to bed at eleven.

Once you do that, you'll learn whether your excitement and interest is real or just a passing phase.

When you want something bad enough, you make the time - regardless of your other obligations. The truth is most people just don't want it bad enough.

Besides, the _perfect_ time never arrives. You're always too young or old or busy or broke or something else.

### Draw a line in the sand

As you get going, keep in mind _why_ you're doing what you're doing. Great businesses have a point of view, not just a product or service. You have to believe in something.

If no one's upset by what you're saying, you're probably not pushing hard enough. (And you're probably boring, too).

### Mission statement impossible

There's a world of difference between truly standing for something and having a mission statement that says you stand for something.

Standing for something isn't just about writing it down. It's about believing it and living it.

### Outside money is Plan Z

Spending other people's money may sound great, but there's a noose attached. - You give up control.

### You need less than you think

Great companies start in garages all the time. Yours can too.

### Start a business, not a startup

A business without a path to profit isn't a business, it's a hobby.

### Building to flip is building to flop

You should be thinking about how to make your project grow and succeed, not how you're going to jump ship. If your whole strategy is based on leaving, chances are you won't get far in the first place.

Would you go into a relationship planning the breakup?

Will money alone truly make you happy? Are you sure you'll like that more than running a business you actually enjoy and believe in?

### Less mass

Right now, you're the smallest, the leanest, and the fastest you'll ever be. From here on out, you'll start accumulating mass. And the more massive an object, the more energy required to change its direction.

## Chapter Progress

### Embrace constraints

Limited resources force you to make do with what you've got. There's no room for waste. And that forces you to be creative.

Constraints forces us to keep the product simple.

Before you sing the "not enough" blues, see how far you can get with what you have.

### Build half a product, not a half-assed product

You can turn a bunch of great ideas into a crappy product real fast by trying to do them all at once. You just can't do everything you want to do and do it well.

You're better off with a kick-ass half than a half-assed whole.

Getting to great starts by cutting out stuff that's merely good.

### Start at the epicenter

If you're opening a hot dog stand, you should worry about the hot dog. That's the epicenter. Everything else is secondary.

### Ignore the details early on

Details make the difference. But getting infatuated with details too early leads to disagreement, meetings, and delays. You get lost in things that don't really matter.

### Making the call is making progress

Whenever you can, swap "Let's think about it" for "Let's decide on it." Commit to making decisions. Don't wait for the perfect solution. Decide and move forward.

Decisions are progress.

You don't have to live with a decision forever. If you make a mistake, you can correct it later.

It doesn't matter how much you plan, you'll still get some stuff wrong anyway. Don't overanalyze.

Long projects zap morale. Make the call and get something out now - while you got the motivation and momentum to do so.

### Be a curator

You don't make a great museum by putting all the art in the world into a single room. That's a warehouse. What makes a museum great is the stuff that's not on the walls. Someone says NO.

Constantly look for things to remove. Stick to what's truly essential.

### Throw less at the problem

When things aren't working, then natural inclination is to throw more at the problem. More people, time, and money. All that ends up doing is making the problem bigger. The right way to go is the opposite direction: Cut back, do less.

### Focus on what won't change

The core of your business should be built around things that won't change. Things that people are going to want today and ten years from now.

### Tone is in your fingers

You can buy the same guitar that Eddie Van Halen uses, but when you play that rig, it's still going to sound like you.

It's tempting for people to obsess over tools instead of what they're going to do with those tools.

Use whatever you've got already or can afford cheaply. Then go. It's not the gear that matters.

### Sell your by-products

Everything has a by-product. Observant and creative business minds spot these by-products and see opportunities.

### Launch now

Once your product does what it needs to do, get it out there.

Think about it this way: If you had to launch your business in two weeks, what would you cut on?

## Chapter Productivity

### Illusions of agreement

The business world is littered with dead documents that do nothing but waste people's time. Reports no one reads, diagrams no one looks at, and specs that never resemble the finished product. There things take forever to make but only seconds to forget.

### Reasons to quit

It's easy to put your head down and just work on what you think needs to be done. It's a lot harder to pull your head up and ask why.

Why are you doing this?!
What problem are you solving?
Is it actually useful?
Are you adding value?
Will this change behavior?
Is there an easier way?
What could you be doing instead?
Is it really worth it?

### Interruption is the enemy of productivity

Interruptions break your workday into a series of work moments.

You can't get meaningful things done when you're constantly going start, stop, start, stop.

### Meetings are toxic

They're usually about words and abstract concepts, not real things.

- Set a timer. When it rigs, meeting is over. Period.
- Invite as few people as possible.
- Always have a clear agenda -the GOAL.
- Begin with a specific problem.
- Meet at the site of the problem instead of a conference room. Point to real things and suggest real changes.
- End with a solution and make someone responsible for implementing it.

### Good enough is fine

A lot of people get off on solving problems with complicated solutions. Find a judo solution, one that delivers maximum efficiency with minimum effort.

When good enough gets the job done, go for it. It's way better than wasting resources or, ever worse, doing nothing because you can't afford the complex solution. And remember, you can usually turn good enough into great later.

### Quick wins

Momentum fuels motivation. It keeps you going. It drives you. Without it, you can't go anywhere. If you aren't motivated by what you're working on, it won't be very good.

The way you build momentum is by getting something done and then moving on to the next thing. No one likes to be stuck on an endless project with no finish line in sight.

To keep your momentum and motivation up, get in the habit of accomplishing small victories along the way. The longer something takes, the less likely it is that you're going to finish it.

If you absolutely have to work on long-term projects, try to dedicate one day a week (or every two weeks) to small victories that generate enthusiasm.

### Don't be a hero

A lot of times it's better to be a quitter than a hero.

If you work on a task that you've estimated will take 2 hours, and it actually is going on for sixteen, it may be a reason to quit. The task was worth it when you thought it would cost two hours, not sixteen.

People automatically associate quitting with failure, but sometimes that's exactly what you should do. If you wasted some time on task, the worst thing you can do is waste some more time on it.

### Go to sleep

Once in a while, you can pull an all-nighter if you fully understand the consequences. Just don't make it a habit.

### Your estimates suck

We're all terrible estimators. We think we can guess how long something will take, when we really have no idea.

Reality never sticks to best-case scenarios.

Break tasks into small parts that you can estimate. It's still going to suck, but less.

### Long lists don't get done

Long lists are guilt trips. The longer the list of unfinished items, the worse you feel about it.

Break that long list down into a bunch of smaller lists.

Don't prioritize with numbers or labels. Prioritize visually. Put the most important thing at the top. You will have single most important thing at the top, and that's enough.

### Make tiny decisions

Big decisions are hard to make and hard to change.

Once ego and price are on the line, you can't change your mind without looking bad.

These small decisions mean you can afford to change.

## Chapter Competitors

### Don't copy

The problem with copying is it skips understanding - and understanding is how you grow. You have to understand why something works or why something is the way it is.

### Decommoditize your product

If you're successful, people will try to copy what you do.

Make you part of your product or service. Inject what's unique about the way you think into what you sell.

### Pick a fight

If you think a competitor suck, say so. When you do that, you'll find that others who agree with you will rally to your side.

Audi takes on Lexus's automatic parking system with ads that say Audi drivers know how to park their own cars.

Having an enemy gives you a great story to tell customers, too. Taking a stand always stands out. People get stoked by conflict. They take sides. Passions are ignited.

### Underdo your competition

Conventional wisdom says that to beat your competitors, you need to one-up them. If they have four features, you need five.

Do less than your competitors to beat them. Solve the simple problems and leave the hairy, difficult, nasty problems to the competition.

The bicycle world provides a great example - high-tech bikes vs. fixed-gear - they are simpler, lighter and don't require as much maintenance.

### Who cares what they're doing?

Because worrying about the competition quickly turns into an obsession.

Focus on yourself instead. When you spend time worrying about someone else, you can't spend that time improving yourself.

## Chapter Evolution

### Say no by default

Soon, the stack of things you've said yes to grows so tall you can't even see the things you should really be doing.

Start getting into the habit of saying no - even to many of your best ideas. Use the power of no to get your priorities straight. You rarely regret saying no. But you often wind up regretting saying yes.

Don't be a jerk about saying no, though. Just be honest.

People are surprisingly understanding when you take the time to explain your point of view. You may even win the over to your way of thinking.

### Let your customers outgrow you

Your product or service becomes so tailored to your current customers that it stops appealing to fresh blood. And that's how your company starts to die.

There are always more people who are not using your product than people who are. Make sure you make it easy for these people to get on board.

People and situations change. You can't be everything to everyone.

### Don't confuse enthusiasm with priority

Coming up with a great idea gives you a rush. You start imagining the possibilities and the benefits. And of course, you want all that right away. Bad move!

What seems like a sure-fire hit right now often gets downgraded to just a "nice to have" by morning. And "nice to have" isn't worth putting everything else on hold.

So let your latest grand ideas cool off for a while first. By all means, have as many great ideas as you can. Get excited about them. Just don't act in the heat of the moment.

### Be at-home good

Don't be in-store product - product that you're more excited about in the store than you're after you've actually used it.

Smart companies make the opposite - something that's at-home good, something you tell your friends about.

You're aiming for a long-term relationship, not a one-night stand.

### Don't write it down

How should you keep track of what customers want? Don't. Listen, but then forget what people said.

The requests that really matter are the ones you'll hear over and over.

The really important stuff doesn't go away.

## Chapter Promotion

### Welcome obscurity

If you've never given a speech before, do you want your first speech to be in front of ten thousand people or ten people?

If millions of people are using your product, every change you make will have a much bigger impact.

These early days of obscurity are something you'll miss later on, when you're really under the microscope. Now's the time to take risks without worrying about embarrassing yourself.

### Build an audience

And audience can be your secret weapon.

When you build an audience, you don't have to buy people's attention - they give it to you. This is a huge advantage.

### Out-teach your competition

Instead of trying to outspend, outsell, or outsponsor competitors, try to out-teach them. Teaching probably isn't something your competitors are even thinking about. Most businesses focus on selling or servicing, but teaching never even occurs to them.

### Emulate chefs

As a business owner, you should share everything you know too.

Businesses are usually paranoid and secretive. The think they have proprietary thing and competitive advantage that. Maybe a rare few do, but most don't. And those that don't should stop acting like those that do. don't be afraid of sharing.

So emulate famous chefs. They cook, so they write cookbooks. What do you do? What are your "recipes"? What's your "cookbook"? What can you tell the world about how you operate that's informative, educational, and promotional?

### Go behind the scenes

Give people a backstage pass and show them how your business works.

People are curious about how things are made. It's why they like factory tours or behind-the-scenes footage on DVDs.

They'll feel a bond with you and see you as human beings instead of a faceless company.

### Nobody likes plastic flowers

Don't be afraid to show your flaws. Imperfections are real and people respond to real.

There's a beauty to imperfection.

So talk like you really talk. Revel things that others are unwilling to discuss. Be upfront about your shortcomings. Show the latest version of what you're working on, even if you're not done yet. It's okay if it's not perfect. You might not seem as professional, but you will seem a lot more genuine.

### Press releases are spam

What do you call a generic pitch sent out to hundreds of strangers hoping that one will bite? Spam.

If you want to get someone's attention, it's silly to do exactly the same thing as everyone else. You need to stand out.

Instead, call someone. Write a personal note. If you read a story about a similar company or product, contact the journalist who wrote it. Pitch her with some passion, some interest, some life.

### Forget about the Wall Street Journal

Chasing WSJ is practically impossible. Niche bloggers are hungry for fresh meat.

### Drug dealers get it right

Drug dealers know their product is so good they're willing to give a little away for free upfront. They know you'll be back for more - with money.

Don't be afraid to give a little away for free - as long as you've got something else to sell.

### Marketing is not department

Marketing is something everyone in your company is doing 24/7/365.

### The myth of the overnight sensation

Dig deeper and you'll usually find people who have busted their asses for years to get into a position where things could take off.

## Chapter Hiring

### Do it yourself first

Never hire anyone to do a job until you've tried to do it yourself first.

You should want to be intimately involved in all aspects of your business. Otherwise you'll wind up in the dark, putting your fate solely in the hands of others. That's dangerous.

### Hire when it hurts

Don't hire for pleasure; hire to kill pain. Always ask yourself: What if we don't hire anyone? Is that extra work that's burdening us really necessary? Can we solve the problem with a slice of software or a change of practice instead? What if we just don't do it?

Similarly, if you lose someone, don't replace him immediately. See how long you can get by without that person and that position. You'll often discover you don't need as many people as you think.

The right time to hire is when there's more work than you can handle for a sustained period of time.

### Pass on great people

Pass on hiring people you don't need, even if you think that person's a great catch. You'll be doing your company more harm than good if you bring in talented people who have nothing important to do.

you start inventing work to keep everyone busy. Artificial work leads to artificial projects. And those artificial projects lead to real costs and complexity.

### Strangers at a cocktail party

If you go to a cocktail party where everyone is a stranger, the conversation is dull and stiff.

A small, intimate dinner party among old friends is a different story, though.

Hire a ton of people rapidly and a "strangers at a cocktail party" problem is exactly what you end up with.

### Resumes are ridiculous

You want a specific candidate who cares specifically about your company, your products, your customers, and your job.

Check cover letter - There is no way an applicant can churn out hundreds of personalized letters.

### Years of irrelevance

Of course, requiring some baseline level of experience can be a good idea when hiring.

There's surprisingly little difference between a candidate with six months of experience and one with six years. The real difference comes from the individual's dedication, personality, and intelligence.

What matters is how well they've been doing it.

### Forget about formal education

There are plenty of intelligent people who don't excel in the classroom.

### Everybody works

You need to avoid hiring delegators - people who love telling others what to do.

### Hire managers of one

Managers of one are people who come up with their own goals and execute them.

You want someone who's capable of building something from scratch and seeing it through.

### Hire great writers

That's because being a good writer is about more than writing.

Clear writing is a sign of clear thinking. Great writers know how to communicate. They make things easy to understand. They can put themselves in someone else's shoes. They know what to omit. And those are qualities you want in any candidate.

### The best are everywhere

It's crazy not to hire the best people just because they live far away.

Had we limited our search only to people in Chicago, we would have missed out on half of the great people we have.

Geography just doesn't matter anymore. Hire the best talent, regardless of where it is.

### Test-drive employees

Interviews are only worth so much. Some people sound like pros but don't work like pros. The best way to do that is to actually see them work. Hire them for a mini-project.

You'll see how they make decisions. You'll see if you get along. You'll see what kind of questions they ask. You'll get to judge them by their actions instead of just their words.

### Own your bad news

When something goes wrong, it's better if it's you who tells the story about it.

People will respect you more if you are open, honest, public, and responsive during a crisis.

### Speed changes everything

Getting back to people quickly is probably the most important thing you can do when it comes to customer service.

Especially true if you offer a personal response. Customers are so used to canned answers, you can really differentiate yourself by answering thoughtfully and showing that you're listening.

### How to say you're sorry

One of the worst ways is the non-apology apology, which sounds like an apology but doesn't really accept any blame (e.g.: "We're sorry if this upset you.")

A good apology accepts responsibility. It has no conditional _if_ phrase attached. It shows people that the buck stops with you. And then it provides real details about what happened and what you're doing to prevent it from happening again. And it seeks a way to make things right.

The number-one principle to keep in mind when you apologize: How would you feel about the apology if you were on the other end?

### Put everyone on the front lines

Listening to customers is the best way to get in tune with a product's strengths and weaknesses.

Everyone on your team should be connected to your customers - maybe not every day, but at least a few times throughout the year. That's the only way your team is going to feel the hurt your customers are experiencing.

Maybe you think you don't have time to interact with customers. Then make time.

### Take a deep breath

People are creatures of habit. That's why they react to change in such a negative way.

But if you ride out that first rocky week, things usually settle down.

Negative reactions are almost always louder and more passionate than positive ones. In fact, you may hear only negative voices even when the majority of your customers are happy about a change.

### You don't create a culture

You don't create a culture. It happens. Culture is action, not words.

### Decisions are temporary

Don't make up problems you don't have yet. Most of the things you worry about never happen anyway.

Besides, the decisions you make today don't need to last forever. If circumstances change, your decisions can change.

Optimize for now and worry about the future later.

### Skip the rock stars

We're all capable of bad, average, and great work. The environment has a lot more to do with great work than most people realize.

There's a ton of untapped potential trapped under lame policies, poor directions, and stifling bureaucracies. Cut the crap and you'll find that people are waiting to do great work.

### They are not thirteen

When everything constantly needs approval, you create a culture of non-thinkers. You create a boss-versus-worker relationships that creams, "I don't trust you."

How much time do you waste writing rule books that never get read?

### Send people home at 5

You don't need more hours; you need better hours.

You shouldn't expect the job to be someone's entire life - at least not if you want to keep them around for a long time.

### Don't scar on the first cut

The second something goes wrong, the natural tendency is to create a policy. "Someone's wearing shorts!? We need a dress code!" No, you don't. You just need to tell John not to wear shorts again.

This is how bureaucracies are born.

Don't create a policy because one person did something wrong once. Policies are only meant for situations that come up over and over again.

### Sound like you

Talk to customers the way you would to friends. Explain things as if you were sitting next to them. Avoid jargon or any sort of corporate-speak. Stay away from buzzwords when normal words will do just fine.

### Four-letter words

There are four-letter words you should never use in business - need, must, can't, easy, just, only and fast.

When you use these four-letter words, you create a black-and-white situation. But the truth is rarely black and white.

### ASAP is poison

When everything is high priority, nothing is high priority.

Reserve your use of emergency language for true emergencies.

## Chapter Conclusion

### Inspiration is perishable

Inspiration has an expiration date. If you want to do something, you've go to do it now. Later, you won't be pumped about it anymore.
