# The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck

The world is constantly telling you that the path to a better life is more, more, more - buy more, own more, make more, fuck more, be more. … Why? My guess: Because giving a fuck about more stuff is good for business.

The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more; it’s giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important.

Stress-related health issues, anxiety disorders, and cases of depression have skyrocketed over the past thirty years, despite the fact that everyone has a flat-screen TV and can have their groceries delivered.

The desire for a more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience. - The more you pursue feeling better all the time, the less satisfied you become, as pursuing something only reinforces the fact that you lack it in the first place.

Being open with your insecurities paradoxically makes you more confident and charismatic around others.

Any attempt to escape the negative, to avoid it or quash it or silence it, only backfires.

Most of us struggle throughout our lives by giving too many fucks in situations where fucks do not deserve to be given.

Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.

You must give a fuck about something - The question, then is - What do we give a fuck about?

If you find yourself consistently giving too many fucks about trivial shit that bothers you - chances are you don’t have much going on in your life to give a legitimate fuck about.

It’s okay for things to suck sometimes.

We suffer for the simple reason that suffering is biologically useful. It’s the mildly dissatisfied and insecure creature that’s going to do the most work to innovate and survive. 

Don’t hope for a life without problems. There is no such thing. Instead, hope for a life full of good problems. 

Happiness comes from solving problems. If you’re avoiding your problems, then you’re going to make yourself miserable. 

If you feel crappy, it’s because your brain is telling you that there’s a problem that’s unaddressed or unresolved. In other words, negative emotions are a call to action. When you feel them, it’s because you’re supposed to do something. Positive emotions, on the other hand, are rewards for taking the proper action.

Choose your struggle - “I want to be happy and have a great family and a job I like” - that doesn’t really mean anything. 

Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for. People who enjoy the struggles or a gym are the ones who run triathlons (etc.)

Technology has solved old economic problems by giving us new psychological problems. It has become an accepted part of our culture that we are all destined to do something truly extraordinary. After all, if everyone were extraordinary, then by definition no one would be extraordinary.

We get to control what our problems mean based on how we choose to think about them, the standard by which we choose to measure them.

In the long run, completing a marathon makes us happier than eating a chocolate cake. Starting a small business with friends while struggling to make ends meet makes us happier than buying a new computer. These activities are stressful, yet they are some of the most meaningful moments and joys we’ll ever do. 

Some of the greatest moments of one’s life are not pleasant, not successful, not known, and not positive.

The real question is - What are we choosing to give a fuck about? What values are we choosing to base our actions on? What metrics are we choosing to use to measure our life? And are those good choices - good values and good metrics?

Manson’s law of avoidance: The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it. You avoid talking to your husband about being more adventurous in the bedroom because that conversation would challenge your identity as a good, moral woman.

If your metric for the value “success by worldly standards” is “Buy a house and a nice car,” and you spend twenty years working your ass off to achieve it, once it’s achieved the metric has nothing left to give you. Then say hello to your midlife crisis, because the problem that drove you your entire adult life was just taken away from you.

Pain is part of the process

If you lack the motivation to make an important change in your life, do something - anything and then harness the reaction to that action as a way to begin motivating yourself.

People can’t solve your problems for you. And they shouldn't try, because that won’t make you happy. You can’t solve other people’s problems for them either, because that likewise won’t make them happy. 

For a relationship to be healthy, both people must be willing and able to both say no and hear no.

We are actually often happier with less. 

You aim to keep your options open as long as possible, you avoid commitment. But there are some experiences that you can have only when you’ve lived in the same place for five years when you’ve been with the same person for over a decade, …

Commitment gives you freedom because you’re no longer distracted by the unimportant and frivolous. It hones your attention and focus, directing them toward what is most efficient at making you healthy and happy. 

Depth is where the gold is buried. You have to stay committed to something and go deep to dig it up. That’s true in relationships, in a career, in building a great lifestyle - in everything.

The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.
