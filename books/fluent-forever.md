> There is no such a thing as a "hard" language; any idiot can speak whatever language his parents spoke when he was a child.

The three keys to Language Learning
- Learn pronunciation first
- Don't translate - otherwise you're practicing translation instead of speaking
- Use spaced repetition systems

What is fluency? It's something different for each of us!

To succeed in an exercise routine, we need to enjoy it or we'll drop it. Successful gym rats learn to find the joy in grueling daily workouts.

Choose a language that you like. Never settle for safe (popular) when you can have fun instead.

### Get yourself some books
- Good grammar book
  - Avoid books systematically detailing every single solitary rule
  - No "Englishy" pronounciation (like Bonjour: bawn-JURE)
- A phrase book
- A frequency dictionary
- A pronunciation guide
- Bilingual dictionary (might be online)
- Monolingual dictionary (a.k.a. devinition dictionary)
- Thematic vocabulary book


## Five Principles to End Forgetting

### Principle 1: Make memories more memorable
- **Structure**: How many capital letters are in the word BEAR?
- **Sound**: Does APPLE rhyme with Snapple?
  - With sound, you'll have a much easier time remembering words
- **Concept**: Is TOOL another word for "instrument"?
  - Abstract or Concrete. Concrete is always better, because they engage more of our brains.
- **Personal Connection**: Do you like PIZZA?
  - Combination of word, picture and personal connection is a winning strategy

First learn easy, concrete words, and then use it to learn abstract words.
Learn the sound system of your language -> Bind those sounds to images -> Bind those images to your past experiences

### Principle 2: Maximize laziness

- Rote repetition is boring, and it doesn't work for long-term memorization
- Take the lazy route instead: study a concept until you can repeat it once without looking and then stop.


### Principle 3: Don't review. Recall.

When you study by reading through a list multiple times, you're practicing reading, not recall. If you want to get better at recalling something, you should practice recalling it.

### Principle 4: Wait, wait! Don't tell me!

- If you can consistently test yourself right befor you forget, you'll double the effectiveness of every test.
- Memory tests are more effective when they're challenging. The close you get to forgetting a word, the more ingrainded it will become when you finally remember it.

### Principle 5: Rewrite the past

When we remember, we don't just access our memories; we rewrite them. This rewriting process is the enginge behind long-term memorization. Every act of recall imbues old memories with a trace of your present-day self. It creates a new connection and associations that make your old memory easier to recall.
