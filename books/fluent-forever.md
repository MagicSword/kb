![Book mindmap](/assets/fluent-forever-mindmap.jpeg)

> There is no such a thing as a "hard" language; any idiot can speak whatever language his parents spoke when he was a child.

The three keys to Language Learning
- Learn pronunciation first
- Don't translate - otherwise, you're practicing translation instead of speaking
- Use spaced repetition systems

What is fluency? It's something different for each of us!

To succeed in an exercise routine, we need to enjoy it or we'll drop it. Successful gym rats learn to find the joy in grueling daily workouts.

Choose a language that you like. Never settle for safe (popular) when you can have fun instead.

### Get yourself some books
- Good grammar book
  - Avoid books systematically detailing every single solitary rule
  - No "Englishy" pronunciation (like Bonjour: bawn-JURE)
- A phrasebook
- A frequency dictionary
- A pronunciation guide
- Bilingual dictionary (might be online)
- Monolingual dictionary (a.k.a. definition dictionary)
- Thematic vocabulary book


## Five Principles to End Forgetting

### Principle 1: Make memories more memorable
- **Structure**: How many capital letters are in the word BEAR?
- **Sound**: Does APPLE rhyme with Snapple?
  - With sound, you'll have a much easier time remembering words
- **Concept**: Is TOOL another word for "instrument"?
  - Abstract or Concrete. Concrete is always better because they engage more of our brains.
- **Personal Connection**: Do you like PIZZA?
  - Combination of word, picture and personal connection is a winning strategy

First learn easy, concrete words, and then use it to learn abstract words.
Learn the sound system of your language -> Bind those sounds to images -> Bind those images to your past experiences

### Principle 2: Maximize laziness

- Rote repetition is boring, and it doesn't work for long-term memorization
- Take the lazy route instead: study a concept until you can repeat it once without looking and then stop.


### Principle 3: Don't review. Recall.

When you study by reading through a list multiple times, you're practicing reading, not recall. If you want to get better at recalling something, you should practice recalling it.

### Principle 4: Wait, wait! Don't tell me!

- If you can consistently test yourself right before you forget, you'll double the effectiveness of every test.
- Memory tests are more effective when they're challenging. The closer you get to forgetting a word, the more ingrained it will become when you finally remember it.

### Principle 5: Rewrite the past

When we remember, we don't just access our memories; we rewrite them. This rewriting process is the engine behind long-term memorization. Every act of recall imbues old memories with a trace of your present-day self. It creates a new connection and associations that make your old memory easier to recall.

### Timing is the key

You can't just grab someone else's flashcards and expect to understand them. You have to create your own deck with a personal connection. That's the key to remember. If you take just a moment to figure out how to remind yourself of the meaning of a word, you can retain that word forever. Spaced repetition systems (SRSs) are flashcards on steroids!


## Sound Play

> Accent is the soul of language; it gives language its feeling and truth.
> - Jean-Jacques Rousseau

- When you're not sure about the way your language sounds, you're stuck learning two languages instead of just one.
- The better you internalize good pronunciation habits in the beginning, the less time you'll waste hunting down broken words.
- People with strong foreign accents are frequently treated as less adept at the language (and less intelligent) then they are, even if this is unfair.


### Train your ears, rewire your brain

- Your brain is hardwired to ignore the differences between foreign sounds. To rewire it, listen to minimal pair in your target language - similar sounding words like `niece` and `knees` and test yourself until your brain adapts to hear these new sounds.
- By practicing in this way, you'll be better equipped to recognize words when they're spoken, and you'll have an easier time memorizing them on your own.


#### Back-Chaining - How to Get Ridiculous Words into Your Mouth

`Höchstgeschwindigkeitsbegrenzung` - Go backwards. Say the end and then add one letter at the time. This makes it easier to finish the word correctly. 

- Impressions matter and your accent makes your first impression in any language.
- Improve your accent by learning the raw ingredients - `the tongue`, `lip` and `vocal cord position` of every new sound you need (Use IPA).

### Train your eyes, see the patterns

It's terrybly difficult to get a student to say `lissen` when he sees a word like `listen`. This problem vanishes as soon as they start using IPA. No one pronounces the `t` in `listen` hen they're reading `lısn`. 

- Every language contains a pattern of connections between its spelling and its sounds. If you can internalize that pattern and make it automatic, you'll save yourself a great deal of work.
- The easiest way to internalize those patterns is to use your SRS. Create flash cards to memorize every spelling pattern you need.
- In the process, approach foreign sounds an complex patterns from as many angles as you can - from their spellings to their sounds, even down to the individual mouth positions used for each sound. You're taking advantage of on of the stranger quirks of learining: the more bits and pieces you learn, the less work it takes to learn them. 

!Do this now: Learn your language's sound system.


## Word Play and the Symphony of a Word

- You can use certain words much more frequently than others. Learn those first.
- Learn [these 625 words](https://fluent-forever.com/appendix5/) first 


### Games with Words

- You can make your words more memorable in two ways
  - Investigate the sotries they tell
  - Connect those stories to your own life
- Use Google Images to find a vivid picture
- Spend moment to find a link between each word and your own experience

### The Gender of a Turnip

"Why doesn't grammar make sense?" - Grammar is a mirror to ourselves. 

- Many languages assign a nonsensical grammatical gender to each of their nouns, which is a standard source of trouble for language learners.
- If your language has grammatical gender, you can memorize it easily if you assign each gender a pariculary vivid action and then imagine each of your nouns performing that action.
  - masculine = exploding (exploding dog), femine = freezing (women on ice)

## Sentence Play

> First you learn the instrument, then you learn the music, then you forget all that s\*\*t and just play.
> - Charlie Parker

Comprehensible input - input that you can understand despite not knowing all words and structures in it.
Kids seem to succeed at language learning where adults fail, but thet's only because they get much more input than we do.
  - They don't worry about making mistakes
  - On average, adults learn languages faster than kids do!
  
- You'll learn fastest if you take advantage of your language machine - the pattern-crunching tool that taught you the grammar of your native language. This machine runs off of comprehensible input - sentences that you understand - so you'll need to find a good source of simple, clear sentences with translations and explanations.
- Take your first sentences out of your grammar book. That way, your sentences can do double duty, teaching you every grammar rule consciously while your language machine works in the background, piecing together an automatic, intuitive understanding of grammar that will rapidly bring you to fluency. 


#### Simplify, Simplify: Turning Mountains into Molehils

All of grammar's infinite possibilities are the product of three basic operations: we `add words`, we `change words` and we `change their order`. That's it.

When to make a flash card:
- Do you see any new words here?
- Do you see any new word forms here?
- Is the word order suprising to you?

Example how to learn abstract vocabulary (word `by`)
![Word order](/assets/fluent-forever-word-order.png)  

- Use your grammar book as a source of simple example sentences and dialogues.
- Pick and choose your favorite examples of each grammar rule. Then break those examples down into new words, word forms and word orders. You'll end up with a pile of effective, easy-to-learn flash cards.


#### Story Time: Making Patterns Memorable

- Languages are often full of complex, hard-to-remember patterns. You can learn these patterns easily by embedding them into simple, understandable stories.
- Whenever you encounter a confusing declension chart in your grammar book, take the nearest example sentence and use it to generate stories that cover every new form you need.
- You'll turn these stories into illustrated flashcards and you'll use those flashcards to learn your language's patterns.

#### Person Action Object: The Mnemonic Images of Memory Champions

`Arnold Schwarzenegger explodiert den Hund`
- Arnold Schwarzenegger - Plural form 1
- Explodes - masculine gender

How do you keep track of all these stories? Make a flascard for each of your mnomonic images!

- Languages often have groups of "irregular" words that follow similar patterns. While you can learn each of these patterns easily with the help of illustrated stories, you may still need some way to remember which words follow which patterns.
- Any time you run into a tricky pattern, choose a person, action or object to help you remember.
- For verb patterns, pick a mnemonic person or an object.
- For noun patterns, use a person or an acition.
- Adjectives fit well with objects, and adverbs fit well with actions.

#### The Power of Output: Your custom language class

Self-directed writing is the ultimate personalized language class. But you need a native speaker to come in and tell you how to say whatevery you want to say.
- Put every correction you recieve into your flash cards. That way, you'll never forget a correction.

![Correction](/assets/fluent-forever-correction-card.png)

- Use writing to teest out your knowledge and find your weak points.
- Use the example sentences in your grammar book as models and write about your interesets.
- Submit your writing to an online exchange community.
- Turn every correction you recieve into a flash card.

#### Word order

- Remove a word from your sentence
- Anytime the position of a word, the form of a word, or the word itself surprises you, then learn it.


## Chapter 6: Language Game

- 1000 words = 75% of the words you read
- 2000 words = 80% of the words you read
- 5500 words = 90%
- 12500 words = 95%
- or start to specialize your vocabulary in what you are interested into

- Learn top 1000 words in your language
- Learn 2000 top words
- Learn remainding words by specializing in what you're interested in

Use monolingual dictionary to describe your word + use also example sentence.

### Self directed writing

- Use Google Images to find quality example sentences and pictures for your words. It's fast, it provides clear examples, and the combination of images and sentences is easy to memorize.
- If you run into problems or you're away from your computer, write out your own example sentences and definitions for new words. Get them corrected and use those corrections to learn both grammar and vocabulary.
- Once you have enough vocabulary under your belt, add a monolingual dictionary to your toolbox. When you do, you'll gain the ability to learn every word in your target language, and as a bonus, your passive vocabulary will grow every time you research and memorize a new term. 

> The more that you read, the more things you will know. THe more that you learn, the more places you'll go.

### Reading for pleasure and profit

- Reading without a dictionary is the simplest, easiest way to grow your passive vocabulary. On average a single book will teach you three hundred ti five hundred words from context alone. By reading just one book in your target language, you'll make all future books and texts of any kind much easier to read.
- By reading in conjunction with an audiobook, you'll have much easier time moving through a long text, and you'll pick up invaluable exposure to the rhythms of your language in action. This will improve your pronunciation, your listening comprehension your vocabulary, your grammer; in short, it will provide a huge boost to every aspect of your language.

- TV series are easier than films
- The problem with subtitles is that reading is easier than listening. Don't use them.

### Listening comprehension for couch potatoes

- Listening is a fast-paced skill that can sometimes feel overwhelming. Take baby steps, and gradually rump up the challenge until you can handle the fastest and hardest of listening challenges (radio, podcasts, ridiculous grabled train station announcments). 
- Start with an interesting foreign TV or dubbed American TV series without subtitles. You can dial down the difficulty by reading episode summaries ahead of time, in order to prepare yourself for the vocabulary and plot twists of each episode.
- As your comfort level grows, wean yourself off summaries and begin watching and listening to more challenging media.

## A Guide to the Flash Cards tha will teach you your language

- Use pictures insead of translations
- Leave little remainders of those memories onyour cards (Paris, 2017). This will make your review proecss much more enjoyable and much more effective


### The Basic Design Principles

- Use each flash card as memorable as possible by linking sounds, spellings, concepts and personal connections
- Many simple cards are better than a few comples cards.
- Always ask for one correct answer at a time.
- When a flash card asks you a question with more than one right answer, accept any right answer.
- If you're having a hard time with a specific concept, then by all means add adiditional cards that put a slightly different spion on closely related information.

### How to make them, how to review them

### Multiple Definitions

`Bar` means a chocolate bar or a place where people usually drink. Create two separate cards for each meaning and accept any correct answer.

### Synonyms 

- Avoid synonyms when learning your first `625` words. You don't need them yet. 
- Bear in mind that no two words are `exactly` alike.
- Make multiple definitions for such a words.

### Category Words

- Words like `Animals` are category words. Use other simple words like `cat`, `dog`, `elefant` to describe category words.
- You can use this strategy even for abstract words like `noun` and `verb`

### Words with Easily Confounded Images

- `Girl` and `Daughter` have a same picture
- Add a personal note to those cards (e.g. name, or another clue - write `Atlantic` to indicate that it's a see and not a lake)
