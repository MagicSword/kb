> There is no such a thing as a "hard" language; any idiot can speak whatever language his parents spoke when he was a child.

The three keys to Language Learning
- Learn pronunciation first
- Don't translate - otherwise, you're practicing translation instead of speaking
- Use spaced repetition systems

What is fluency? It's something different for each of us!

To succeed in an exercise routine, we need to enjoy it or we'll drop it. Successful gym rats learn to find the joy in grueling daily workouts.

Choose a language that you like. Never settle for safe (popular) when you can have fun instead.

### Get yourself some books
- Good grammar book
  - Avoid books systematically detailing every single solitary rule
  - No "Englishy" pronunciation (like Bonjour: bawn-JURE)
- A phrasebook
- A frequency dictionary
- A pronunciation guide
- Bilingual dictionary (might be online)
- Monolingual dictionary (a.k.a. definition dictionary)
- Thematic vocabulary book


## Five Principles to End Forgetting

### Principle 1: Make memories more memorable
- **Structure**: How many capital letters are in the word BEAR?
- **Sound**: Does APPLE rhyme with Snapple?
  - With sound, you'll have a much easier time remembering words
- **Concept**: Is TOOL another word for "instrument"?
  - Abstract or Concrete. Concrete is always better because they engage more of our brains.
- **Personal Connection**: Do you like PIZZA?
  - Combination of word, picture and personal connection is a winning strategy

First learn easy, concrete words, and then use it to learn abstract words.
Learn the sound system of your language -> Bind those sounds to images -> Bind those images to your past experiences

### Principle 2: Maximize laziness

- Rote repetition is boring, and it doesn't work for long-term memorization
- Take the lazy route instead: study a concept until you can repeat it once without looking and then stop.


### Principle 3: Don't review. Recall.

When you study by reading through a list multiple times, you're practicing reading, not recall. If you want to get better at recalling something, you should practice recalling it.

### Principle 4: Wait, wait! Don't tell me!

- If you can consistently test yourself right before you forget, you'll double the effectiveness of every test.
- Memory tests are more effective when they're challenging. The closer you get to forgetting a word, the more ingrained it will become when you finally remember it.

### Principle 5: Rewrite the past

When we remember, we don't just access our memories; we rewrite them. This rewriting process is the engine behind long-term memorization. Every act of recall imbues old memories with a trace of your present-day self. It creates a new connection and associations that make your old memory easier to recall.

### Timing is the key

You can't just grab someone else's flashcards and expect to understand them. You have to create your own deck with a personal connection. That's the key to remember. If you take just a moment to figure out how to remind yourself of the meaning of a word, you can retain that word forever. Spaced repetition systems (SRSs) are flashcards on steroids!


## Sound Play

> Accent is the soul of language; it gives language its feeling and truth.
> - Jean-Jacques Rousseau

- When you're not sure about the way your language sounds, you're stuck learning two languages instead of just one.
- The better you internalize good pronunciation habits in the beginning, the less time you'll waste hunting down broken words.
- People with strong foreign accents are frequently treated as less adept at the language (and less intelligent) then they are, even if this is unfair.


### Train your ears, rewire your brain

- Your brain is hardwired to ignore the differences between foreign sounds. To rewire it, listen to minimal pair in your target language - similar sounding words like `niece` and `knees` and test yourself until your brain adapts to hear these new sounds.
- By practicing in this way, you'll be better equipped to recognize words when they're spoken, and you'll have an easier time memorizing them on your own.


#### Back-Chaining - How to Get Ridiculous Words into Your Mouth

`Höchstgeschwindigkeitsbegrenzung` - Go backwards. Say the end and then add one letter at the time. This makes it easier to finish the word correctly. 

- Impressions matter and your accent makes your first impression in any language.
- Improve your accent by learning the raw ingredients - `the tongue`, `lip` and `vocal cord position` of every new sound you need (Use IPA).

### Train your eyes, see the patterns

It's terrybly difficult to get a student to say `lissen` when he sees a word like `listen`. This problem vanishes as soon as they start using IPA. No one pronounces the `t` in `listen` hen they're reading `lısn`. 

- Every language contains a pattern of connections between its spelling and its sounds. If you can internalize that pattern and make it automatic, you'll save yourself a great deal of work.
- The easiest way to internalize those patterns is to use your SRS. Create flash cards to memorize every spelling pattern you need.
- In the process, approach foreign sounds an complex patterns from as many angles as you can - from their spellings to their sounds, even down to the individual mouth positions used for each sound. You're taking advantage of on of the stranger quirks of learining: the more bits and pieces you learn, the less work it takes to learn them. 

!Do this now: Learn your language's sound system.
