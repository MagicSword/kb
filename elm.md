# Elm - programming language

## Prons

- No runtime errors - that's huge!
- Everything is explicit
  - No surprise where this comes from
  - but alos requires passing stuff around and adds lines of code
- Immutable

## Cons

- Slow development of the ecosystem
  - One leader to follow
    - Not safe approach
    - To much work for one guy
  - No regular updates on blog nor the libraries
- Missing good Routing library
- No serverside rendering
- Sometimes code is unecessary long
  - `let in` tends to spread across a lot of lines
