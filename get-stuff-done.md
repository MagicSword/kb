# The Little Handbook for Getting Stuff Done

- You begin to **believe in yourself**
- The fix is to make the **start as small as possible**, create conditions that make you more likely to start, and then to practice starting over and over until you get good
- **create focus sessions**, where you practice staying focused on one task for a short period of time (10-15min)
- Perfectionism - commit to starting imperfectly, just start even if things are messy - **create shitty first draft!** and cleanup later
- **Focus on important tasks a majority of the time**, youâ€™ll be getting stuff done
- **Keep it simple**
- Do not blame others for your difficulties in getting things done
- **Do not overplan**
