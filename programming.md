## Localization & Internationalization best practices

### Split translation files into multiple files 

TODO: WHY?

### Use unique and descriptive IDs

Ideally it should give a clear context where it's being used. 

```
# Bad
new-event = "Add new event"

# Better
calendar.month-view.add-new-event = "Add new event"
```

### Avoid concatenations, use placeholders instead

This gives translators ability to control grammar structure. It won't be `tos-text + tos-link` in every language!

```
# Wrong 
tos-text = By proceeding you accept the
tos-link = Terms of Services

# Better
tos-text = By proceeding you accept the {{link}}
tos-link = Terms of Services
```

### Don't reuse strings in different contexts

Some words have might have multiple meanings in different context, but that doesn't mean that it's the same for another lagnuages. Take `free` as an example.

### Don't hardcode characters

When you put a space at the end of the string, you can be sure that someone will eventually trim that space in translation. 

```
# Wrong
sum = "Summary: "

# Better
sum = "Summary:"
```

### Design adaptible UI

When designing the UI, keep in mind that some translated strings will be much longer than in your default language and may not fit in your designed UI.
